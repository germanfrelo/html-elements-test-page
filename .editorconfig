# Local .editorconfig file

# This file should only include settings that affect the physical contents of the file, not just how it appears in an editor.
# Do not include personal preference presentation settings like a tab's `indent_size` in this file; those should be specified in a parent .editorconfig file outside of the repository.

# Ensure that personal preference presentation settings can be inherited from parent .editorconfig files.
